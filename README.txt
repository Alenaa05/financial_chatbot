🤖 Financial Chatbot using Python

A beginner-friendly financial chatbot that uses **predefined logic** to answer common queries based on a company's financial data stored in a CSV file. This project is perfect for those new to Python, data analysis, and basic chatbot development.



📌 Project Description

This chatbot prototype allows users to interact with basic financial information, such as total revenue or net income change over time, using predefined questions. The goal is to simulate how real-world AI chatbots handle data-driven queries — but using a simplified rule-based approach for educational purposes.

It reads data from a cleaned CSV file and responds based on your selected query. The chatbot also includes basic data visualization (bar charts for total revenue) using `matplotlib`.
